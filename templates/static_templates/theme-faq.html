<h2>e-huesped BASICS</h2>
<strong>Who can take an e-huesped course? How do I sign up ?</strong>
<p>e-huesped courses are open to everyone*. All you need is access to a computer with a current browser, an Internet connection, and, of course, a desire to learn.
To sign up, create an edX account and then register for the course of your choice. Choose <a href="http://e-huesped.com/register">Register Now</a> to get started. Unless you choose a verified certificate, registration is free!</p>
<p>*Except Professional Courses</p>
<strong>What browsers are supported for use with e-huesped courses?</strong>
<p>Our courseware works best with current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari, or with Internet Explorer version 9 and above.</p>
<strong>What if I have technical trouble with registration, login, or course access?</strong>
<p>Many problems with registration, login, or access to e-huesped courses are caused by browser issues. Here are some things to try:
- Switch to a current version of Chrome or Firefox
- Check your browser settings to ensure both JavaScript and cookies are enabled
- Clear your browser's cache</p>
<strong>What does it cost to take a course?</strong>
<p>With the exception of specified professional education courses, e-huesped courses are free for everyone. Some courses have a fee for verified certificates but are free to audit.</p>
<strong>Do e-huesped courses have transcripts?</strong>
<p>Yes. e-huesped course videos have interactive transcripts, which can be accessed by clicking the Closed Captions (cc) tab in the lower right corner of the video player.  Transcripts will appear to the right of the screen.</p>
<strong>Can I access e-huesped courses on my smart phone or tablet computer?</strong>
<p>At this time, e-huesped does not fully support access with mobile devices. While many components of your courses will function, some may not.</p>
<strong>What happens if I have to quit a course? Will I be able to take the same or another course in the future?</strong>
<p>You may unregister from an e-huesped course at anytime. There are absolutely no academic penalties associated with incomplete e-huesped studies. You may register for the same course (provided we are still offering it) at a later time.
Note: If you registered and paid for a verified certificate, refunds are only available while verified registration is open your course. To request a refund, contact info@huesped.org and include your order number as well as the course you are dropping.</p>
<strong>What is the e-huesped <a href="http://e-huesped.com/tos">honor code </a>?</strong>
<p>Youâ€™ll find the e-huesped honor code <a href="http://e-huesped.com/tos">here</a>. Each course may also have specific agreements for student collaboration and discussion.</p>
<strong>I love e-huesped! How can I donate to the organization?</strong>
</p>Thank you! Please visit our <a href="https://www.huesped.org.ar/dona/vos">donate page </a>. Any contribution is greatly appreciated.</p>
